# Seminar 1 Preparation

## Seminar 1: Requirements Gathering

Read the Behaviour Driven Development (2020) pages and then use the Gherkin language to create a Gherkin sequence that
addresses ONE of the following examples:

- Using a new coffee making machine.
- Interfacing with a new SatNav system.
- Using a computer running the Linux operating system.
- Getting familiar with a new vehicle.
- Creating a batch or shell script.

Your response should consist of at least three scenarios describing different roles such as administrator, user, driver
and so on. Be prepared to share your scenarios at this week's seminar. You can test your Gherkin scripts in the Behave
engine.

There will also be an opportunity to review your teamâ€™s progress during the seminar.
